          So, what's the point of Pinewood Chapel, anyway? There’s already a site (<a href=>BurlingtonRetro</a>) that documents the history and memories of Burlington much better than I ever could. There's even books that do the same! And what's with the name, Pinewood Chapel? What does that even have to do with Burlington at all? The answer to all of those questions is found in two words: <i>convenience</i> and <i>time</i>. Up until my recent graduation, I'd been saving old schoolwork, assignments, pictures taken from inside each building my friends and I had gone to out of a vague sense of <i>"one day we’ll want to remember this place."</i> Unsurprisingly, many of my friends asked me to upload all of these old files and photos to the cloud and share them. I started, then got carried away. Here we are. This site isn't a living scrapbook or yearbook, like BurlingtonRetro, it's a museum exhibit titled "Life as a Burlington student, 2012-2025 AD". It's the very opposite of living. Pinewood Chapel is a dead thing which is on display. As for the name, I couldn't really come up with something all that unique, so I thought of something vaguely Burlington-ish. That is all.

          A decision has been made, and it's to restrict guest users' file access to (non-intrusive) documents and slideshows that don't feature people's faces. This was in large part due to the absolute absurd file size of the Burlington High School folder and zip file, which had to be segmented into several separate folders. Some of them almost exclusively have documents and slideshows, while others have images and videos (which will most likely be restricted for guest users).

          File archive access (even for full users) will be unavailable until I return home from vacation and start uploading the archived files onto the cloud…and then sort them as best I can for the website. I also have to somehow fix the corrupted zip files that contain the majority of BHS schoolwork, photos, etc. from the years 2021-2025. File access for guest users will probably have to be restricted somewhat once it’s implemented due to privacy issues and whatnot (some people might not exactly want their pictures shown on the World Wide Web!).
